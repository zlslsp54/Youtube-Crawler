US Release Date: April 5, 2019 Starring: Nick Cannon, Rhys Wakefield, Nora Arnezeder Directed By: Rhys Wakefield Synopsis: Raffy Rivers is a fading movie star in need of a career revival. His writer friend, Evan, has never tasted success. Both believe their zombie script will provide the breakthrough they so desperately need -- if only they could finish the damn thing. When Evan realizes that neither has felt true fear, the pair set out to trick each other into feeling it. The events turn deadly serious as a prank goes wrong and a surprise visitor is killed. In the frantic aftermath, the friends must keep their cool as they decide how best to hide the body. This is made infinitely more difficult by hallucinatory drugs, an ex-girlfriend, a clingy police officer, and a pack of hungry coyotes. Throughout the chaos, Raffy and Evan still valiantly attempt to finish the script, even enlisting their guests to serve as director and supporting actor. Eventually the tension proves too much. The story builds to a frenzy in the final act as we learn every character has secret motives -- ones they are willing to kill for. Watch More: ? New Indie Trailers: http://bit.ly/2Ey7fYy ?

US Release Date: April 5, 2019 Starring: Alec Baldwin, Emilio Estevez, Jena Malone Directed By: Emilio Estevez Synopsis: In ""The Public"" an unusually bitter Arctic blast has made its way to downtown Cincinnati and the front doors of the public library where the action of the film takes place. At odds with library officials over how to handle the extreme weather event, some homeless patrons turn the building into a shelter for the night by staging an ""Occupy"" sit in. What begins as an act of civil disobedience becomes a stand-off with police and a rush-to-judgment media constantly speculating about what's really happening. This David versus Goliath story tackles some of our nation's most challenging issues, homelessness and mental illness and sets the drama inside one of the last bastions of democracy-in-action: your public library.

US Release Date: 2019 Directed By: Suzannah Herbert & Lauren Belfer Synopsis: Hoop Dreams goes to the mat in WRESTLE, an intimate coming-of-age documentary about four members of a high-school wrestling team at Huntsville's J.O. Johnson High School, a longstanding entry on Alabama's list of failing schools. Coached by teacher Chris Scribner, teammates Jailen, Jamario, Teague, and Jaquan each face challenges far beyond a shot at the State Championship: splintered family lives, drug use, teenage pregnancy, mental health struggles, and run-ins with the law threaten to derail their success on the mat and lock any doors that could otherwise open. Tough-love coach Scribner isn't off the hook, either; he must come to terms with his own past conflicts while unwittingly wading into the complexities of race, class and privilege in the South. Director Suzannah Herbert and Co-Director Lauren Belfer captured over 650 hours of footage during the course of the team's final season to create this closely observed, deeply affecting depiction of growing up disadvantaged in America today.

Subscribe to the channel and click the bell icon to stay up to date. US Release Date: January 11, 2019 Starring: Cameron Monaghan, Grayson Gabriel, Peyton List Directed By: Robin Hays Synopsis: Anthem tells the story of Luke (Monaghan) a teenager who foresees the death of his new best friend Stan (MacNicoll), the most popular guy in school. When this premonition becomes reality, Luke must deal with the trials and tribulations of being dubbed ""The Prophet of Death"" and being titled a freak by the entire town. It doesn't help that he's fallen in love with Faith (List) who just happens to be Stan's girl or that he's on the outs with his childhood best friend Fang (Grayson Gabriel) or that the premonitions just keep coming - In a story that expertly navigates that often rocky, at times inspiring road to adulthood, Anthem authentically balances the teenage experience of confusion, anxiety and rage with those exceptional moments of clarity, self discovery and human connection. Hormonal, funny, exhilarating and wise, Anthem slyly explores the need to belong, the isolation of youth and the powerful brew of fear truth and noise that plays inside us all. Watch More: ?

She spends her days making videos using her thumbs as actors - thumbs that bicker about things like whether Yogi Bear is a moral or existential nihilist. But Anna doesn't show these videos to anyone and no one knows what they are for. A week before her birthday her Mum serves her an ultimatum - she needs to move out of the shed, get a haircut that doesn't put her gender in question and stop dressing like a homeless teenager. Naturally, Anna tells her Mum to ""back the f-off"". However, when her school friend comes to visit, Anna's self-imposed isolation becomes impossible to maintain. Soon she is entangled with a troubled eight year old boy obsessed with Westerns, and the local estate agent whose awkward interpersonal skills continually undermine his attempts to seduce her.

It is in this context of quiet desperation that a writing workshop has been set up to help a group of seven young people integrate into the world of work. Under the guidance of well-known novelist Olivia Dejazet, the participants are asked to write a noir fiction connected with the industrial past of their hometown. Session after session, one of them, a boy named Antoine, stands out. Provocative and aggressive, he gets noticed by his systematic opposition to all, including Olivia. Even more alarming, the story he has devised and that he reads aloud, the cold description of a mass murder seen through the eyes of its perpetrator, proves very disturbing. Antoine understands the killer too well. At this point, Olivia starts experiencing a feeling of attraction-repulsion to Antoine. Watch More: ? New Indie Trailers: http://bit.ly/2Ey7fYy ?

She is determined to nurture 'from the inside' a project of civil rights education, but her Guarani-speaking high-school students resist her civics lessons ? and she quickly realizes that gaining their trust won't be an easy task. These subtly illuminating encounters reverberate in the aftermath of the central event of the film ? a harrowing sexual assault by a group of young men. Paulina's unfathomable actions, and the limits of social justice, are examined unflinchingly in this 'social thriller' of will and sacrifice.

The exquisite feature film debut of visionary fashion designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy (Rodarte), Woodshock is a hypnotic exploration of isolation, paranoia, and grief that exists in a dream-world all its own. Kirsten Dunst stars as Theresa, a haunted young woman spiraling in the wake of profound loss, torn between her fractured emotional state and the reality-altering effects of a potent cannabinoid drug. Immersive, spellbinding, and sublime, Woodshock transcends genre to become a singularly thrilling cinematic experience that marks the arrival of the Mulleavy siblings as a major new voice in film.

The attackers do not confront or acknowledge Jesse, and Jesse does not engage or pursue the attackers¡¦ he simply backs away. Why did this happen? Could Jesse have done more? Did he have an obligation? These are the questions posed by VIOLET, a carefully calibrated character study of the process of coping in the midst of senseless trauma.

Several tourists have vanished while relaxing on the beautiful beaches of the Channel Coast. Infamous inspectors Machin and Malfoy soon gather that the epicenter of these mysterious disappearances must be Slack Bay, a unique site where the Slack river and the sea join only at high tide. There lives a small community of fishermen and other oyster farmers. Among them evolves a curious family, the Br?fort, renowned ferrymen of the Slack Bay, lead by the father nick-named ""The Eternal"", who rules as best as he can on his prankster bunch of sons, especially the impetuous Ma Loute, aged 18. Towering high above the bay stands the Van Peteghems' mansion. Every summer, this bourgeois family - all degenerate and decadent from inbreeding - stagnates in the villa, not without mingling during their leisure hours of walking, sailing or bathing, with the ordinary local people, Ma Loute and the other Br?forts. Over the course of five days, as starts a peculiar love story between Ma Loute and the young and mischievous Billie Van Peteghem, confusion and mystification will descend on both families, shaking their convictions, foundations and way of life.
